# planePython
Library for visualizing telemetry data of an RC plane written in Python. Written by Simon Hock and me. Replaced by github.com/peteole/telemetry
## setup
Requires the python libraries tk  and serial.
## functionality
This project implements the basic functionality for visualizing flight data (artificial horizon, speed display, altitude display, battery indicator...). It can read the serial port to get new flight data, but was swaped to a html website at this point of the development process due to python performance issues.
